Software Craftmanship
=====================

In preparation for our user group meeting please go through these instructions to ensure your machine is set up. If we
all run sbt for the first time at the meeting then the wireless is going to become useless.

 - [Install sbt 0.13](http://www.scala-sbt.org/release/docs/Getting-Started/Setup.html). Note Earlier versions may not work.
 - [Install git](http://git-scm.com/downloads). Your IDE probably includes it but having it on the command line will help
provide unity of instruction in some of the exercises.
 - [Sign up for GitHub](https://github.com) (if you don't have an account)

 - Clone this repository
```sh
  git clone https://github.com/philborlin/craftmanship.git
```

 - Compile the project
```sh
   cd craftmanship
   sbt compile
```

This will prepare you for the meeting.

The meeting will have a short presentation (15 mins) which will go over a quick introduction to software craftmanship. I'll introduce you
to some of my heroes (Kent Beck, Ward Cunningham, and Uncle Bob) and we'll talk about TDD and pair programming. After that it will be
all coding.

We will go over three programming katas for 20 minutes a piece. This will be you and your pair coding. Throughout the katas you will
have an opportunity to pair three different people and pairing always seems to teach you something you didn't know. After that we'll
run a randori and get a chance to work in a group atmosphere.
